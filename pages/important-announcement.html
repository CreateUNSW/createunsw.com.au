                <h2>Important Announcement following the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>

                <h5>All face-to-face club events are suspended.</h5>
                   <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face club events are suspended until further notice. We are currently exploring options to move workshops or activities online.</p>
                <h5>Information to members currently taking ENGG1000</h5>
                <p>CREATE and the UNSW makerspaces, two very key contributors to ENGG1000's demand in terms of guidance, materials, electronics, equipment and space, are trying our best to coordinate and ensure you have access to everything you need to complete the project under the constraints being imposed.</p>
                <p>Based on demand and under the assumption that the course continues to run, the sales store remains operational with changed conditions so that you don't have to go hunting for them all over the city. Please let us know via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CreateUnsw/" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> if this is something that you would use and want.</p>
				<p>CREATE has historically worked closely with ENGG1000 students, running workshops to train them in basic skills they need for the course, and selling components at cheap prices. We are actively exploring ways to move some of this content online so you can still access it.</p>
				<p>Please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CreateUnsw/" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> for the latest arrangement, or if any of you want to purchase components, please message our page and one of us will arrange a pickup outside MCIC. Please check our <a href="https://www.createunsw.com.au/catalogue/" target="_blank">Online Sales Store</a> for pricing (stock subject to availability).</p>
                <p>Thank you and stay safe! Try and maintain a safe distance from others working in the space and practise good hygiene.</p>
                <p>The CREATE Executive Team</p>
