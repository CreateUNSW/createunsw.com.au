				<h2>About CREATE</h2>
				<p>Founded in October 2012, CREATE NSW Inc. is a student-led organisation and 
					maker-club situated at UNSW Sydney.
				</p>
				<p>
					The core aim of CREATE is to provide opportunities for students to learn practical 
					skills in engineering, innovation and design as well as collaborate on shared ideas 
					and projects. By maintaining an active community of like-minded ‘makers’ and providing 
					resources, knowledge and technology, the club seeks to foster an environment where anyone, 
					regardless of their background, can be inspired to turn their ideas into designs, prototypes 
					and products. We are firm believers in collective knowledge, learning and cooperation as 
					an effective way to expand what is possible for any individual to accomplish.
				</p>
				<p>
					CREATE runs an array of varying activities to help facilitate this ideal. The team hosts 
					a series of workshops teaching basic technical skills in Arduino electrical interfacing 
					and programming as well as Computer Aided Design (CAD) modelling with digital fabrication. 
					CREATE also fosters team projects including: Project Illuminate making annual entries into 
					the VIVID Sydney Light Festival and participating teams in the Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) 
					hosted by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Lastly, they operate the sales of 
					affordable electrical and robotic components at UNSW during semester, to supply students 
					with the parts they need for projects big or small.
				</p>
				<p>
					CREATE has gained many accomplishments over the years, and strives to continue expanding 
					their community and carry forth the maker movement of UNSW. <b>Some of these achievements include:</b>
