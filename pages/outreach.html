                <p>CREATE hosts an Outreach Program that aims to inspire younger students with the practical applications of STEMs learning. Our team runs a select few set of workshops that teach basic technical skills, and do not require any prior knowledge. </p>
                <p>Our workshops are written to adapt well with whatever requirements your school needs.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that since our team runs completely by university students, our availability may be limited by exam periods defined by UNSW Sydney <b>below</b> or other major deadlines in our projects.</p>

                            By far our most popular series of workshops yet, this series of Arduino workshops 
                            will get you started into robotic projects.

                            This workshop teaches the fundamentals in computer programming and electronic components. 
                            The Arduino programming language is derived from C++, a universal programming language 
                            adapted in a majority of the software you see today. Each series aims to develop a final 
                            product, for example: a robotic car.

                            CREATE hosts a series of workshops teaching computer aided design or CAD, whereby you 
                            generate 3D model representations of objects digitally. It is highly useful for producing 
                            detailed renders for presentation as well as modelling and testing prototypes before 
                            manufacture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this series, CREATE also teaches basic digital fabrication techniques in laser cutting 
                            and 3D printing, both of which can be done in UNSW’s makerspaces. They enable versatile 
                            prototyping in 2D and 3D respectively
