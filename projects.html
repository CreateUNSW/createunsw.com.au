					<p><img src="/images/logos/unsw-illuminate-dark.png" class="projectintro">UNSW Illuminate is a student project that aims to empower students to apply hands-on skills on large scale professional and multidisciplinary projects. We seek to foster deep interactions between designers and engineers, allowing students to realise their creative visions while gaining practical design and manufacturing experience. This project combines the creativity of art and the innovation of engineering to demonstrate the magic of art meeting technology through light. </p>
					<p>The previous successor CREATE Project Illuminate (a collaborating team of CREATE UNSW & UNSW MAKE CLUB) is now rebranded as <b>UNSW Illuminate</b> and operating as a student project under UNSW Engineering ChallENG program, while the project will still remains in close collaboration with CREATE</p>

                    <p>The Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) is a robotics competition hosted annually by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) for three years running. Its aim is to design and build small, autonomous vehicles which can race around a track against one other competitor using only computer vision and ultrasonic sensors. Each year, CREATE hosts internal competitions and sends the two most successful teams up to participate in the competition.</p>
                    <p>We have found continuing success with new teams taking up the challenge, with CREATE placing 1st in 2016 and 2017 and 3rd in 2018. In building and programming their vehicles, our project members learn invaluable skills including hardware design, electrical interfacing and programming autonomous driving functions.</p>

With financial and logistical assistnace from CREATE and our broad community, any proposed idea could be turned into a reality whether itâ€™s just a passion project, competitive team submission or an innovative startup idea. All of our former projects were founded under this program including; Flight Labs UNSW (formerly CREATE UAS), our UGV platform Debbie and BB8 robot.</p>

                    <p>We can kick-start your project with:</p>
                    <p>~ Basic Management Tools and Advice <br>
                    ~ Dedicated Technical Advisor<br>
                    ~ Marketing to Set Up a Team of Keen Individuals to Learn and Assist<br>
										~ Allocated Funding of up to $500 to help you get started, with Additional Funding as the Project Expands.</p>
