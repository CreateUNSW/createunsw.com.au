                    <p><img src="/images/logos/create_project_illuminate_navyblue_transparent.png" class="projectintro">Project Illuminate encompasses designing, constructing and programming light installations for the yearly VIVID Sydney Light Festival. The team has made four entries from 2015 - Robotic Pacman, Mondrian Cube, Crystallise and Synergy. These artworks are also exhibited outside of the festival including the Sydney Mini Maker Faire, UNSW O-Week, UNSW Arts Week and Robotic Pacman featured at the Museum of Contemporary Art.</p>
                    <p>Project Illuminate offers a unique multi-disciplinary experience to student collaborators, challenging artists, designers and engineers alike to design and produce an original and innovative artwork throughout its full development cycle</p>
										<p>Project Illuminate is a joint-team of CREATE UNSW and sister club MAKE CLUB (based at UNSW Art & Design) since July 2017.</p>

                    <p>The Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) is a robotics competition hosted annually by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) for three years running. Its aim is to design and build small, autonomous vehicles which can race around a track against one other competitor using only computer vision and ultrasonic sensors. Each year, CREATE hosts internal competitions and sends the two most successful teams up to participate in the competition.</p>
                    <p>We have found continuing success with new teams taking up the challenge, with CREATE placing 1st in 2016 and 2017 and 3rd in 2018. In building and programming their vehicles, our project members learn invaluable skills including hardware design, electrical interfacing and programming autonomous driving functions.</p>
