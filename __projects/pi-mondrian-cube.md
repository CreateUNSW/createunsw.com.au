The Mondrian Cube was first commissioned for the Vivid Sydney 2016 festival. Taking inspiration from Dutch artist Piet Mondrian and the De Stilj movement, this two-metre-tall interactive lighting installation features bold dark lines enclosing blocks of primary colours. Visitors of the Vivid festival can change the colour arrangement of each side by simply pressing against each rectangular block, thus creating their own Mondrian artwork.</p><p>

The installation was wholly built and designed by undergraduate UNSW students from different faculties and disciplines. Though the Mondrian Cube, CREATE encouraged members to push beyond their boundaries and manage a real-life engineering project, allowing them to develop valuable skills through student collaboration.</p><p>

<strong>Artists:</strong> Christopher Ho, Yunzhen Zhang, Scott Fraser</p><p>

<strong>Collaborators:</strong> Jessica Tanzil, Laura Gonz√°lez Llamazares, Daniel Castillo</p><p>
