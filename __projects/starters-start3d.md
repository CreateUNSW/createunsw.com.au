We are building 1 METER CUBED 3D printer. The printer will feature a huge build volume, high accuracy printing as well as carbon fiber, nylon, polycarbonate, composite and metal filament printing capabilities. This is an exciting project and a great starting point for anyone new to CREATE.

We are currently in the process of establishing team roles and structure. We meet every Monday evening at the MCIC.

If you are interested in joining the team, head over to CREATE Starters to sign up.
