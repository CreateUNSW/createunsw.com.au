CREATE Project Illuminate is now rebranded as **UNSW Illuminate** and operating as a student project under UNSW Engineering ChallENG program, while the project will still remains in close collaboration with CREATE

Synergy is our fifth year of invovlement with the Vivid Sydney festival. This project also marks our first collaboration with MAKE CLUB (est. 2016), CREATE’s sister club from university’s Art & Design campus. In addition, the existing Vivid Team within CREATE has been officially branded Project Illuminate. This has been done to mark the welcome introduction of skilled designers into our team, our long-term commitment to the Vivid Sydney program, and this team’s unique specialisation in interactive artworks.

Synergy presents a pretty tableau from nature - a large plywood tree surrounded by ferns. This deceptively simple scene however, represents the interlinked mechanisms of a superorganism. In these complex beings, inconspicuous organisms demonstrate emergent properties by sharing signals and nutrients for the greater good of the collective. In Synergy, this survival mechanism is demonstrated by the illumination of the ferns which are triggered by the passage of visitors along the path.

The Project Illuminate Team for 2018 is led by Jonathan Hribar, with project management and support from Junji Moey and MAKE CLUB President Tsz Kin William Liu. The team consists upwards of 40 people who participate in artistic design, engineering design, operations, marketing, construction and maintenance.

For aspiring engineers and designers, this project provides provision of practical skills in project management, design and fabrication skills, client relations, collaboration and communication. It represents an experience-rich opportunity for the maker community to sink their teeth into and supplement their university studies. Synergy also marks CREATE’s most ambitious project to date, a feat which would not have been possible without the combination of all the member’s skills and experiences.
