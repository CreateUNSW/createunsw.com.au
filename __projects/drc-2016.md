For the second consecutive year, UNSW wins the student robotics challenge. It was a proud day for UNSW CREATE students from Team Mature – Harry Dudley-Bestow (Mechatronics), Jabez Thomas (Computer Science) and Jack Scott(Mechatronics) – who won the QUT Droid Racing Challenge (DRC) in Queensland. The team competed successfully against 10 qualifying teams from seven Australasian universities at the beginning of July.
