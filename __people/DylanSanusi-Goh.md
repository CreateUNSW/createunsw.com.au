Hi! I’m Dylan, and I’m experienced and passionate about all sorts of maker technologies.
I help make stuff for startups, competitions and large organisations. <br>

Since young, I’ve been heavily involved in projects with unmanned aerial systems, robotics, embedded systems and programming. This has expanded to a love for makerspace communities and education. <br>

For 2019, I’m the Vice President of Technology for CREATE & Technical Director for Project Illuminate: Vivid Sydney 2019. <br>

I’m also involved with Flight Labs UNSW, the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge, ENGG1000 and a few startups here and there. Come say hi!
