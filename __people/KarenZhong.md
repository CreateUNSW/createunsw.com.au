2017 - Head of Media and Marketing

Karen Zhong started with CREATE by directly joining the Media and Marketing role and slowly expanded her knowledge from within. Volunteering at the weekly CREATE sales stall has provided her with more technical experience and allowed Karen to see firsthand what our members were looking for and to advertise our workshops. The CREATE mailing list has grown to over 2000 members with the newsletters are an important way to communicate the many projects and events run by the society.
