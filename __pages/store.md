## Stall

During university terms (not including summer term) we run a stall on Globe Lawn on Mondays from 12:00-16:00. In the case of wet weather, the stall will likely be cancelled depending on conditions. Follow our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/CreateUnsw) for up to date information.

#### Pickups

<p>We offer pickups for orders, but you must buy at least $5 worth of components for pickup, otherwise please come to the Monday Stall for pickups. Send us an email at {% include sales/email.html %} and we'll organise a time.</p> <p><b>Currently for Term 2 2021</b>: <u>Pickups are only for those who need products urgently </u>(updated 27th June 2021). Generally pickups will be at the lockers in the hallway behind the MCIC makerspace. (Please enter via Hilmer Building Entrance and go through the double doors next to the disabled unisex toilets and the lockers will be the final set of the lockers before the double doors at the other end.) Make sure you've confimed the pickup time via email before coming to the lockers.</p>

#### Payments

We take cash and card. If you need an invoice to get reimbursed by faculty, let us know at {% include sales/email.html %}

#### Refunds and Replacements

We offer full refunds and replacements (depending on stock availability) on all items.

## FAQs

#### Do you offer delivery?

We only offer delivery on bulk orders (over $250). Send us an email at {% include sales/email.html %} to enquire.

#### When will this component be back in stock?

If you urgently need something that is out of stock, please look for other options such as jaycar or ebay. Our components are normally ordered in bulk from overseas, so restocking times may be long.

#### Can you supply components or custom kits for my course or program?

Yes! We've worked with course conveners and lecturers in the past to supply components for courses such as ENGG1000 and BIOM1010. In 2020 we produced kits for a UNSW Girls in Engineering workshop including procurement, packaging, and delivery of kits.

Send us an email at {% include sales/email.html %} with the quantities and components required. We can consult on project kit design and offer reduced prices for bulk orders. 

Our team has a range of mentoring and tutoring experience and can recommend course staff from within our network.

#### Can you run an extra stall for my course?

Generally we run an extra stall during the later weeks of ENGG1000 on build days for convenient last-minute parts. If you'd like us to do something similar for your course send us an email at {% include sales/email.html %}.
