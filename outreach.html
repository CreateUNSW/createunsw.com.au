            <p>CREATE hosts an Outreach Program that aims to inspire younger students with the practical applications of
                STEMs
                learning. Our team runs a select few set of workshops that teach basic technical skills, and do not
                require any
                prior knowledge. </p>
            <p>Our workshops are written to adapt well with whatever requirements your school needs.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that since our team runs completely by university students, our availability may
                be
                limited by exam periods defined by UNSW Sydney <b>below</b> or other major deadlines in our projects.
            </p>
            <h4>UNSW Sydney exams periods in 2019:</h4>
            <p>2 May 2019 - 18 May 2019</p>
            <p>13 Aug 2019 – 31 Aug 2019</p>

            <button class="accordion">Arduino Programming and Electrical Interfacing</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><img src="/images/arduino.jpg" class="projectintro">By far our most popular series of workshops yet,
                    this
                    series of Arduino workshops will get you started into robotic projects.</p>
                <p>This workshop teaches the fundamentals in computer programming and electronic components.</p>
                <p>The Arduino programming language is derived from C++, a universal programming language adapted in a
                    majority
                    of the software you see today.</p>
                <p>Each series aims to develop a final product, for example: a robotic car.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Digital Fabrication</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p><img src="/images/20180430_CREATE_CAD1-0015.jpg" class="projectintro">CREATE hosts a series of
                    workshops
                    teaching computer aided design or CAD, whereby you generate 3D model representations of objects
                    digitally. It
                    is highly useful for producing detailed renders for presentation as well as modelling and testing
                    prototypes
                    before manufacture.</p>
                <p>In this series, CREATE also teaches basic digital fabrication techniques in laser cutting and 3D
                    printing,
                    both of which can be done in UNSW’s makerspaces. They enable versatile prototyping in 2D and 3D
                    respectively.
