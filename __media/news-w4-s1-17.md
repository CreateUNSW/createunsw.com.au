It's finally time for our Arduino Workshop Series! As always the workshops are free to attend and finish with FREE PIZZA! Don't be afraid if you have no electronics or programming experience -- we've designed the course to be a really easy gateway into DIY coding and circuits from absolute scratch. Scroll down to find out more.

Want to rewatch last week's Electronics workshop? Catch up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGbQXiPBpMI).

Our sales stall on Monday will be at Globe Lawn from 12 - 4pm. If it is raining we will be in front of MCIC instead! Check out our online [store](http://www.createunsw.com.au/store/).


## HACKERSPACE: MONDAY (27th March) 6-8PM
### MCIC Ground Floor - ARDUINO PART 1

What's an arduino? It's a low-cost, open-source microcontroller. It provides an easy way to interface sensors that interact with the external environment to the electrical hardware you wish to control.

Whilst the workshop series itself is free, we will recommend all those attending to purchase one our Arduino kits. We offer two types of kits - a basic kit ($20) and a full kit ($50). The kits contain a fantastic variety of experimental components as well as all of the necessities including the Arduino, a breadboard and jumper wires. Arduino Kits are now for sale at our weekly sales stall (Globe Lawn, Mondays 12-4pm) or at the MCIC. For our workshops, an Arduino UNO can be borrowed in exchange for your student card.
See here for more information about the kit.

### ---------  What else to bring --------

Your laptop! The software used in the workshops is free and easy to download and install, if you are able to do this before the workshop we can get right to the fun stuff.
- The current Arduino IDE, free to install: Arduino software
- Some libraries to operate parts that come with the kits: Library.

If you can't make it to the workshop, watch our live stream on YouTube and check out our Facebook event. See you there! :)

Thanks to everyone who came last week!
