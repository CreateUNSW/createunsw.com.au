Our THIRD AND FINAL Arduino workshop is on Monday!

As usual our sales stall will be at Globe Lawn on Monday 12 - 4pm or in front of MCIC if it's raining! Check out our online store.

## HACKERSPACE: MONDAY (10 April) 6-8PM
### MCIC Ground Floor - ARDUINO PART 3

### What's an arduino?
A low-cost, open-source microcontroller. It provides an easy way to interface sensors that interact with the external environment to the electrical hardware you wish to control.

### Do I need equipment?
We suggest buying a kit if you don't have one from the previous weeks. There are two options: the basic $20 kit or a comprehensive kit with the option of either an UNO or MEGA. They have a fantastic variety of components as well as all of the necessities. See here for more info. They are available at the Monday sales stall or at the workshop.

### What else to bring?
Your laptop! The workshop software is free and easy to install, best to do this before the workshop so we can get right to the fun stuff.
- The current Arduino IDE: Arduino software
- Some libraries to operate parts that come with the kits: Library.

### Complete beginner?
Not a problem, we teach you everything!

### Hungry?
Free pizza afterwards!

### Still can't attend?
We have a Youtube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/c/createunsw/live) and the recording will be available afterwards.
