This week we are continuing the Hackerspace workshops with Part 2 of Electronics! Thanks to those who came to Part 1 last week, if you missed it or want to rewatch, you can find the video recording here.

## HACKERSPACE W4
### MONDAY (20th March) 6-8PM
### MCIC Ground Floor - ELECTRONICS - Solder a light display

Come down to Michael Crouch Innovation Centre on the ground floor of the Material Science building for Part 2 of the Electronics workshop with CREATE!

This week we're continuing with working on electronics and learning how to solder, and how it is useful in circuit design. If you missed the first part or you're a complete beginner, you can still buy the kit and follow along while making your own interactive lighting circuit. Kits are $10 and are available at the workshop or on our Monday sales stall.

The workshop is FREE along with the PIZZA after, so come along, learn a cool new skill, make some new friends with the same interests all while getting fed for the night! If you can't make it to the workshop, watch our live stream [here](http://www.youtube.com/c/createunsw/live) on YouTube. Join us on the Facebook event.

## Want to build your own self driving car?
CREATE is looking for new people to join one of our 5 established teams, or to make their own teams, to do just that. Whether you want to do this as a learning experience just for fun, or whether you're taking yourselves seriously enough to try to become one of the two teams that we send up to a competition in Queensland this year, you should totally come along to our getting-started-again meeting this Monday, 6pm in the MCIC. Special shoutout to anyone who wants to get their hands dirty with OpenCV image processing software, as most teams presently lack a dedicated software person.
