From the 10 February 2019, CREATE is delighted to publish a refreshing website, designed by Tsz Kin LIU (William), the head of the website team in the media and marketing sub-committee. The website has been improved in terms of the layout, design and functionality. <br>

William has spent a month since the beginning of 2019, from prototyping to coding the website with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Jekyll, a static site generator, and some imported javascript.

He said the website design is inspired by the CREATE colour palette and his experiences of viewing the previous CREATE website.
<h4>Some of the changes include:</h4>

-- New images from the recent CREATE events.<br>
-- A bio for all current executives and showcase our diversed degree backgrounds and knowledges.<br>
-- Portfolio-styled project page to see all our projects on one page.<br>
-- Search and filter fuctions in the Store Page (CREATE Online Store).<br>
-- Detailed event calendar for each university terms.<br>
-- Refreshing media and project blog sites.<br>
-- A new outreach page for the public to find out our outreach program for younger makers and students.<br>

William would also like to acknowledge his team member Leesa Dang (A current computer science student) and the executive team for supporting this website rebranding.
