Thanks to everyone who came along to our BBQ on Monday! We've got an exciting semester planned with our first Hackerspace workshop of the year coming up and many of our project teams are recruiting. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn some great skills and work with a team to produce a project that you might even get to take to Queensland - read on to find out more.

## HACKERSPACE W3
###  MONDAY 6-8PM MCIC
### ELECTRONICS - Simple Circuitry on Breadboards
CREATE's workshop presenter will be guiding us through simple circuitry on breadboards. This workshop is suitable for complete beginners. Anyone can come along and learn, or for some practical experience you can purchase the kit for $10 at the workshop or at our sales stall. See below for the full list of workshops for Sem 1.


## SALES STALL
### Week 3 Mon 13 March 12-4pm - Globe Lawn

Don't forget our sales stall running every Monday! This will be the perfect place to pick up any electronics components you need such as motors, breadboards or wires, ENGG1000 parts or ask questions  about putting it all together. Check out everything we will be selling on our store website.

## Quadcopter Orders
Passionate about aerial photography and filming? Want to do your own surveying and mapping? We are now accepting orders for quadcopters!

Whether you want the thrill of flying or want to take stunning landscape pics, you will love our quadcopter kits, containing everything you need to make it fly.


## RECRUITING - UAS

CREATE Unmanned Aerial Systems is looking for new members, especially Compsci students, that have experience in ROS, C++ and image recognition. You will gain extensive experience in the Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle industry and have lots of chances to test your own ideas. Email uas@createunsw.com.au if intereted.

## Calling design/arts/COFA students
Come to the Monday Hackerspace workshop for a new project discussion. You may have an opportunity to design the walkway in front of the MCIC building.

## Want to build your own self driving car?
CREATE is looking for new people to join one of our 5 established teams, or to make their own teams, to do just that. Whether you want to do this as a learning experience just for fun, or whether you're taking yourselves seriously enough to try to become one of the two teams that we send up to a competition in Queensland this year, you should totally come along to our getting-started-again meeting this Monday, 6pm in the MCIC. Special shoutout to anyone who wants to get their hands dirty with OpenCV image processing software, as most teams presently lack a dedicated software person.
