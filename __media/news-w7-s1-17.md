Here is your chance to learn AutoCAD! This is a fantastic skill that is highly in demand for all engineers and will come in handy in lots of assignments.

This week our Monday 12-4pm sales stall will be in front of MCIC! Check out our online store.


## HACKERSPACE: MONDAY (24 April) 6-8PM
### MCIC Ground Floor - AutoCAD 2D/3D Basics

What is CAD? Computer-aided design! We use software to design the parts of a project and ensure that it all connects together before building it. This week we focus on basic 2D and 3D.

### Do I need equipment?
Please bring a laptop with a mouse! Modelling without a mouse is a real pain.

### Software?
AutoCAD and Inventor are free and easy to install, best to do this before the workshop so we can get right to the fun stuff. Get both by registering for an account here and make sure you use your uni email to sign up so it's free.

### Complete beginner?
Not a problem, we teach you everything!

### Hungry?
Free pizza afterwards!

### Still can't attend?
We have a Youtube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/c/createunsw/live) and the recording will be available afterwards.


Thanks to everyone who came last week for Arduino!
