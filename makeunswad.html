					<h3>About MAKE CLUB</h3>
                    <p>MAKE Club is a student-run initiative at UNSW Art and Design guided by the belief that anyone can be a Maker. </p>
					<p>As the first Constituent Clubs at the UNSW Faculty of Art & Design, established in 2016. We hold workshops, consultations and facilitate collaborations so students can bring into realisation any fun or professional projects they may have in their minds. We aim to promote and share the love of making and encourage a hands-on approach to learning about materials, tools, programs and crafts.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, our goal is to hold workshops which scratch your curiosity and empower your creative projects.</p>

				<h3>History of MAKE CLUB and sister club partnership with CREATE UNSW</h3>
					<p>Founded by the founding President Nila Rezaei, who was inspired by the makers movement from CREATE, leading to the establishment of an art & design making club and the first constituent club at the UNSW Faculty of Art & Design in the year 2016. 
                    <p>MAKE Club is a sister club of CREATE UNSW since year 2016. In late 2017, both clubs have strengthened their sister partnership, and formed a cross club collaborative team PROJECT ILLUMINATE. The team completed SYNERGY, a Vivid Sydney 2018 Light Installation Entry, the very first artwork collaborated between the artists and the engineers.</p>
